Pentesting and auditing FreeIPA/Red Hat Identity Management environments - the Linux counterpart of Active Directory - often proved to be a tedious task. The lack of proper visualization makes it hard to quickly identify overly privileged accounts, leaving potential attack paths hidden in plain sight.

**IDMHound** addresses this blind spot. 

It is a BloodHound collector designed to graph identities and relationships within a FreeIPA/IdM realm, helping pentesters and IAM auditors quickly understand privilege structures and risks.
